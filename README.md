## Headsup

This repo comes with templates and fillers (subjects and attributes) we used to generate underspecified questions for the gender, nationality, ethnicity, and religion datasets;
and code for training and evaluating QA and LMs.
```diff

# Prerequisites
First make a data directory ``mkdir ./data``. All generated data, model predictions, and analysis logs will be dumped there.

The modules in this repo are structured like this:
```
./qa      # code for training and prediction of QA models.
./qa_hf   # code for predicting using QA models specifically trained via HuggingFace's interfaces (e.g. run_squad.py).
./lm      # code for predicting using masked language models (LMs) via HuggingFace's transformer interfaces.
./visualization   # jupyter notebooks for reproducing plots in our paper.
./templates       # code for dataset generation.
./word_lists      # templates and slot fillers for dataset generation.
./utils           # some utilities
```


# 1. Generating Underspecified Questions

The goal here is to generate examples from templates like below:
```
Paragraph: [x1] lives in the same city with [x2].
Subjects (x): Gerald; Jennifer.
Question: Who [attr]?
Attributes (attr): was a hunter; can never be a hunter
```

The templates, subjects, and attributes can be found at:
```
./word_lists/slots/
./word_lists/subjects/
./word_lists/activities/
```

**Gender-occupation for QA models** Let us generate the gender-occupation dataset for QA models as an example:
```
TYPE=slot_act_map
SUBJ=mixed_gender
SLOT=gender_noact
ACT=occupation_rev1
FILE=slotmap_${SUBJ//_}_${ACT//_}_${SLOT//_}
python3 -m templates.generate_underspecified_templates --template_type ${TYPE} \
  --subj $SUBJ --act $ACT --slot $SLOT \
  --output ./data/${FILE}.source.json
```
which will dump the input examples into a json file which is kinda large (~few GB).

While this generation step is model-agnostic, in some special cases it would be helpful to add some domain triggers.
For instance, when using the NewsQA data released in [Multi-QA](https://github.com/alontalmor/MultiQA), it is very important to add a special header, that widely occurs in the training data, to every example.
To do that, simply specify ``--filler newsqa`` when calling the ``generate_underspecified_templates`` module.

**Gender-occupation for masked LMs** For masked LM, we will use a different set of templates and fillers. For instance, dataset for RoBERTa models will use its own set of in-vocabulary subjects:
```
TYPE=slot_act_map
SUBJ=mixed_gender_roberta
SLOT=gender_noact_lm
ACT=occupation_rev1
FILE=slotmap_${SUBJ//_}_${ACT//_}_${SLOT//_}
python3 -m templates.generate_underspecified_templates --template_type $TYPE \
  --subj $SUBJ --act $ACT --slot $SLOT \
  --output ./data/${FILE}.source.json
```

**Datasets other than gender-occupation**
Other datasets are generated in a very similar way, just change the subjects/attributes/templates files. For reference, here is how to generate the nationality dataset:
```
TYPE=slot_act_map
SUBJ=country
SLOT=country_noact
ACT=biased_country
FILE=slotmap_${SUBJ//_}_${ACT//_}_${SLOT//_}
python3 -m templates.generate_underspecified_templates --template_type ${TYPE} \
  --subj $SUBJ --act $ACT --slot $SLOT \
  --output ./data/${FILE}.source.json
```
Again, as noted at the top, the attributes at ``./word_lists/biased_country`` are not publically visible. Please contact us for access if you need them.

# 2. Predicting on Underspecified Questions

Assuming QA models are already trained via HuggingFace's interfaces, e.g., ``run_squad.py``, we will show how to run trained model over the generated data.
In case you need to train QA models from scratch, please jump to the Appendix below and look for model training instructions.
Here we will use the gender-occupation data as an illustration.
The same script pattern applies to other datasets.

**Using QA models on gender-occupation data** Assuming a RoBERTa-base SQuAD model is located at ``./data/roberta-base-squad/``, let us use it to predict on the gender-occupation dataset:
```
TYPE=slot_act_map
SUBJ=mixed_gender
SLOT=gender_noact
ACT=occupation_rev1
FILE=slotmap_${SUBJ//_}_${ACT//_}_${SLOT//_}
MODEL=./data/roberta-base-squad/
python3 -m qa_hf.predict --gpuid [GPUID] \
  --hf_model ${MODEL} \
  --input ${FILE}.source.json --output ./data/robertabase_gender.output.json
```
where ``[GPUID]`` is the device index. A prediction json file will be dumped (kinda large, ~few GB).
There are few QA models already trained by HuggingFace. To use them just set the ``--hf_model`` to the QA model name.

**Using masked LMs on gender-occupation data** For masked LM, run the following:
```
TYPE=slot_act_map
SUBJ=mixed_gender_roberta
SLOT=gender_noact_lm
ACT=occupation_rev1
FILE=slotmap_${SUBJ//_}_${ACT//_}_${SLOT//_}
MODEL=roberta-base
python3 -u -m lm.predict --gpuid [GPUID] --transformer_type $MODEL --use_he_she 1 \
  --input ${FILE}.source.json --output ./data/robertabase_lm_gender.output.json
```
where ``--use_he_she 1`` specifies that the gendered pronouns (he/she) will be used along with gendered names.
That is, e.g., the probability of name ``John`` is ``max(P(John), P(he))``.

# 3. Aggregating Model Predictions and Extracting Bias Scores

**Evaluating on gender-occupation data** 
Here comes the meat. Here is a script to run analysis over predicted files from the 15 models on the gender-occupatin data:
```
for DATA in gender lm_gender; do
for MODEL in robertabase robertalarge distilbert bertbase bertlarge; do
  python3 analysis.py --metrics subj_bias,subj_position,subj_negation --input ./data/${MODEL}_${DATA}.output.json --group_by gender_act --verbose 1 | tee ./data/${MODEL}_${DATA}.log.txt
done
done
DATA=gender
for MODEL in newsqa_robertabase newsqa_robertalarge newsqa_distilbert newsqa_bertbase newsqa_bertlarge; do
  python3 analysis.py --metrics subj_bias,subj_position,subj_negation --input ./data/${MODEL}_${DATA}.output.json --group_by gender_act --verbose 1 | tee ./data/${MODEL}_${DATA}.log.txt
done
```
where the ``--input`` points to the predicted files in json format,
``--group_by gender_act`` specifies that gendered names will be clustered into binary gender when measuring the association with attributes (i.e. occupations),
and ``--metrics`` specifies the list of metrics to aggregate.

**Evaluating on nationality data**
For nationality dataset, run the following:
```
for DATA in country lm_country; do
for MODEL in robertabase robertalarge distilbert bertbase bertlarge; do
  python3 analysis.py --metrics subj_bias,subj_position,subj_negation --input ./data/${MODEL}_${DATA}.output.json --group_by subj_act --verbose 1 | tee ./data/${MODEL}_${DATA}.log.txt
done
done
DATA=country
for MODEL in newsqa_robertabase newsqa_robertalarge newsqa_distilbert newsqa_bertbase newsqa_bertlarge; do
  python3 analysis.py --metrics subj_bias,subj_position,subj_negation --input ./data/${MODEL}_${DATA}.output.json --group_by subj_act --verbose 1 | tee ./data/${MODEL}_${DATA}.log.txt
done
```
where the ``--group_by subj_act`` will run analysis over each subject-attribute pairs.
Alternatively, you can use ``--group_by subj`` to get analysis at subject level.

The same pattern applies to ethnicity and religion evaluations.

### Visualization

After ``*.log.txt`` files got generated, you can reproduce the plots in the paper by jupyter notebooks located at ``./visualization/``.

# Appendix

### Training your own QA models via HuggingFace
Note that HuggingFace provided a few SQuAD models already trained. You can directly use them for the prediction step above.
This section is for models that are not provided officially by HuggingFace.

Say you want to train a DistilBERT model on SQuADv1.1 (without downstream distillation, i.e. what we used in the paper).
First have SQuADv1.1 data (json files) located at ``./data/squad/``.
Then:
```
DATA_DIR=/path/to/data/in/this/dir
SQUAD_DIR=$DATA_DIR/squad/
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python3 -u run_squad.py \
  --model_type distilbert \
  --model_name_or_path distilbert-base-uncased \
  --do_train \
  --do_eval \
  --train_file $SQUAD_DIR/train-v1.1.json \
  --predict_file $SQUAD_DIR/dev-v1.1.json \
  --per_gpu_train_batch_size 20 \
  --learning_rate 3e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 2.0 \
  --max_seq_length 384 \
  --doc_stride 128 \
  --seed 3435 \
  --do_lower_case \
  --overwrite_cache \
  --output_dir $DATA_DIR/distilbert-base-uncased-squad/
```

For NewsQA data, you might have to hack the ``run_squad.py`` file a bit to make it run smoothly.
In case it still doesn't work, you can use the method below.

### Training your own QA models without HuggingFace's ``run_squad.py``
Say you want to traina DistilBERT model on NewsQA data (without downstream distillation, i.e. what we used in the paper).
First have NewsQA data (json files) located at ``./data/newsqa/``.
We used the version from [here](https://github.com/alontalmor/MultiQA) in SQuAD format.

One way to train your own model is via HuggingFace's ``run_squad.py`` script and adapt it to NewsQA data.
Another way is doing it without it:
```
python3 -u -m qa.preprocess --dir ./data/newsqa/ --batch_size 20 --max_seq_l 336 --verbose 0 --transformer_type distilbert-base-uncased --train_data NewsQA_train.json --dev_data NewsQA_dev.json --output newsqa.distilbert

GPUID=[GPUID]
LR=0.00003
BERT_TYPE=distilbert-base-uncased
MODEL=data/newsqa_seqtok_distilbert
python3 -u -m qa.train --gpuid $GPUID --dir data/newsqa/ \
--transformer_type $BERT_TYPE \
--train_data newsqa.distilbert.train.hdf5 \
--train_res newsqa.distilbert.train.tok_answer.txt,newsqa.distilbert.train.context.txt,newsqa.distilbert.train.query_id.txt \
--learning_rate $LR --epochs 2 \
--enc bert --cls linear --percent 1.0 --div_percent 0.9 \
--save_file $MODEL | tee ${MODEL}.txt
```
where ``[GPUID]`` specifies the GPU device index.
It will dump a trained model (in hdf5 format) to the ``./data/`` directory.

Note that the saved model is not in HuggingFace's format, so we need a different prediction step:
```
python3 predict.py --gpuid [GPUID] \
  --load_file data/${MODEL} --transformer_type $BERT_TYPE \
  --input ${FILE}.source.json --output ./data/${OUTPUT}.output.json
```
where the ``$FILE`` and ``$OUTPUT`` customized for each data and QA model. Please refer to the Section **Prediction** above.

### Interactive Demo

There is an interactive demo that could come in handy. It will load a trained model, let you type in examples one by one, and predict them.

In case you want to play a bit with trained QA models (the ones trained *without* HuggingFace), you can run, e.g.,:
```
python3 -u -m qa.demo --load_file ./data/newsqa_seqtok_distilbert --gpuid [GPUID]
```
where ``./data/newsqa_seqtok_distilbert`` is the ``hdf5`` model file trained above.

For pretrained LM, you can run:
```
python3 -u -m lm.demo --transformer_type distilbert-base-uncased --gpuid [GPUID]
```
